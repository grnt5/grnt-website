                This was a group term project I worked on for the course 36-315 - Statistical Graphics and Visualization at Carnegie Mellon 
                University in the Spring 2024 semester. In this project, we analyzed data about shots made by players in the NHL to answer a series
                 of research questions. I was responsible for answering the question of where on the ice do players tend to make more shots and 
                 goals. Through visualizing spatial data with heatmaps and using logistic regression to predict goals based on shot location and 
                 angle, we inferred that goals are made more when a player is closer to the net and makes a straighter shot.

                I would like to give my greatest thanks to my group members Melos Bekaj, Lay Len Ching, and Silas Wang for their contributions to 
                their own questions and the write-up.
            </p>
