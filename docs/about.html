                 &emsp; Hello! My name is Grant Allvin. I am a new university graduate on the hunt for a job in data. I love to learn about many different 
                 disciplines and applications in and out of tech, and will do whatever it takes to get familiar with the unfamiliar in the ultimate
                  goal of getting the job done.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                 &emsp; In December of 2024, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics and Machine Learning and
                 a minor in Decision Science. In my primary studies, I gained considerable experience working with R and Python to solve problems with 
                 data-driven solutions. In my coursework, I have become well-read in practices such as statistical inference, modeling for machine learning, 
                 and data visualization. I have applied my skills and knowhow in data science to a variety of 
                 applications, such as quantitative linguistics, sports analytics, and policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                 &emsp; Though not all of my experience has involved working with numbers. My employment as a part-time worker and intern has been all over 
                the place. I've been a server at a country club, a desk clerk for the Air Force, and a teaching assistant at my university, among 
                other things. I believe these experiences have been very helpful in shaping the way I communicate in different settings, which goes 
                hand-in-hand with using data to tell a story. I have also dabbled in web development (such as with this website) and game development 
                as a programmer and an artist.
            </p>

                 &emsp; In my free time, I like to make arts and crafts, play games, and explore new restaurants in the city. Lately, I've been really into making 
                papercraft models in Blender, playing Pump it Up, and trying coffee and milk tea drinks at Roll Play, a Vietnamese restaurant 
                based in the DMV area.
