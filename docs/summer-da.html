            <p>This was a group term project I worked on for the course 88-223 - Decision Analysis at Carnegie Mellon University in the Spring 2023
                 Semester. In this project, we identified some choices for how Brady - our classmate and group member - should spend his summer 
                 break, and determined the best ones using adjusted cost-benefit and sensitivity analyses based on factors such as finances, 
                 enjoyment, and usefulness of the choice to his future. We determined that the best way for Brady to spend his summer break would 
                 be to work at his internship at Payliance. If that and all of his other internship offers fall through, then his next best option 
                 would be to work at the golf course in his hometown.
            </p>

                I would like to give my greatest thanks to my group members Erica Zheng, Mennatallah Barghout, and Brady Hess for their 
                contributions to the project, and to my professor Russell Golman for his assistance.
            </p>
